# ProConnect Identité - Installation Guide

This guide provides steps to run the ProConnect Identité Node.js application locally while managing its dependencies in Docker containers.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20) installed locally (we suggest the usage of [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- Docker (>= v25) and Docker Compose (>= v2.24) installed ([doc](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/))
- Clone the ProConnect Identité repository

## Setting Up Dependencies with Docker

1. **Start Dependencies**: Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository and run:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

   This will start all required services (e.g., databases) defined in the `docker-compose.yml`.

## Setting Up the Node.js Application

1. **Install Node.js Dependencies**:

   Inside the project’s root directory, run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create a local version of dotenv file**: Inside the project's root directory, run:

   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```

   This will create a local copy of the `.env` file containing the environnement variables to run ProConnect Identité.

3. **Get your own INSEE api credential**: or use the one of your teammates.

   Fetch them at https://api.gouv.fr/les-api/sirene_v3.

   Then fill your `.env` file with them.

4. **Database Initialization**: The database will be automatically initialized with data from `scripts/fixtures.sql`.

   ```bash
   npm run fixtures:load
   ```

## Running the Application

After setting up the application, start the Node.js server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application is now available at http://localhost:3000.

To log in, use the email address user@yopmail.com and the password "user@yopmail.com".

Emails are not sent but printed in the console.

## Testing the Connection with a Test Client

ProConnect Identité is provided with a test client: https://github.com/numerique-gouv/proconnect-test-client

This container is launched within the ProConnect Identité `docker-compose.yml`.

It's available at http://localhost:3001

## Testing edge cases

In our OIDC provider project,
navigating through certain paths can be particularly challenging due to the diverse range of scenarios that may arise.

Recognizing this complexity,
we provide comprehensive datasets and associated configurations
tailored for executing specific test cases.

You can manually execute a Cypress end-to-end test
to thoroughly explore these paths by following [this doc](./cypress/README.md).

## Connecting to local databases

Docker Compose initializes both a PostgreSQL and a Redis database.

To connect to these databases, use the following commands:

```bash
docker compose exec db psql postgres://moncomptepro:moncomptepro@db:5432/moncomptepro
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -h redis -p 6379
```

## Configuring different environment variables

The default environment variables are defined in the `.env` file, which applies to all environments. Based on the `NODE_ENV` variable, the corresponding file is selected: `.env.development` for the development environment, `.env.production` for production, or `.env.test` for testing.

To customize or override these defaults, we recommend using the `.env*.local` files. The file `.env.<NODE_ENV>.local` will have higher priority over both `.env.local` and `.env.<NODE_ENV>`.

## Skipping Cypress Binary Installation for Local Setup

If you prefer not to run end-to-end tests locally and want to avoid downloading the large Cypress binary, you can prevent it during the installation process. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=0 npm install
```

This command ensures that the Cypress binary is not downloaded, saving time and disk space during the installation process.

## Document your change

We use changeset to manage our changelog. You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

To create a new changeset, run the following command:

```bash
npx changeset
```

You will be prompted to select the type of change you want to make.  
As this changelog is for end frensh users, we recommend you write your change in french :fr:.

Commit your changes and push them in your branch.  
We will merge a "Version Packages" PR when we are ready to release :wink:
